# My-Mcp-Server

This repository demonstrates the use of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) in AI development.  MCP enhances AI agents by providing structured access to tools and resources, improving context management and task completion.

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a framework that allows AI agents to interact with tools and resources in a structured and organized manner.  This improves the agent's ability to understand and respond to complex requests by providing a clear pathway to access and utilize external information and capabilities.  Key benefits include:

* **Enhanced Context Management:** MCP helps maintain context throughout a conversation or task, preventing information loss and improving the accuracy of responses.
* **Structured Tool Access:**  Tools are defined with clear input and output schemas, ensuring consistent and reliable interaction.
* **Improved Task Completion:** By providing access to a wider range of tools and resources, MCP enables AI agents to complete more complex tasks.
* **Extensibility:** New tools and resources can be easily added to the system, expanding the agent's capabilities.

## Repository Structure

This repository contains several projects demonstrating MCP's capabilities:

* **Joke Generator:** A simple joke generator that fetches jokes from an external API.
* **Fun Fact Generator:** A simple fun fact generator that fetches facts from an external API.

Each project includes its own `app.py`, `mcp_server.py`, `requirements.txt`, and `README.md` files.

## Importance of this Repository

This repository serves as a practical example of how MCP can be used to build more capable and robust AI agents.  It demonstrates the benefits of structured tool access and context management, showcasing how these features can lead to improved task completion and a more seamless user experience.  The modular design allows for easy expansion and integration of new tools and resources.

## Further Development

Future development could include:

* Adding more diverse tools and resources.
* Implementing more sophisticated context management techniques.
* Exploring advanced use cases for MCP in different AI applications.
